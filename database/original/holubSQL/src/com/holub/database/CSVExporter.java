 *	Pass this exporter to a {@link Table#export} implementation to

 *	//...
 *	Writer out = new FileWriter( "people.csv" );
 *	people.export( new CSVExporter(out) );
 *	out.close();

 *	The output file for a table called "name" with
 *	columns "first," "last," and "addrId" would look
 *	like this:
 *	<PRE>
 *	name
 *	first,	last,	addrId
 *	Fred,	Flintstone,	1
 *	Wilma,	Flintstone,	1
 *	Allen,	Holub,	0
 *	</PRE>
 *	The first line is the table name, the second line
 *	identifies the columns, and the subsequent lines define
 *	the rows.
