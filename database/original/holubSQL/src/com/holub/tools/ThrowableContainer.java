/** A convenient container for realying a checked Exception
 *  from a method that can't declare a throws clause to
 *  a calling method that can.  This doesn't happen very
 *  often, but occasionally you don't want to declare
 *  an interface method as throwing an exception that
 *  one of the methods called from the implementation
 *  actually throws. Use it like this:
 *
 *	<PRE>
 *	inteface X
 *	{	void interfaceMethod(); // throws nothing.
 *	}
 *
 *	void interfaceMethod()
 *	{	try
 *		{
 *			g();	// throws an IOException
 *		}
 *		catch( IOException e )
 *		{	throw new ThrowableContainer( e );
 *		}
 *	}
 *
 *	void caller(X implementation) thows IOException
 *	{	try
 *		{	implementation.interfaceMethod();
 *		}
 *		catch( ThrowableContainer e )
 *		{	throw (IOException)(e.contents());
 *		}
 *	}
